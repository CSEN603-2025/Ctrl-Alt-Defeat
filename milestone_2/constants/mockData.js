I was able to apply my academic knowledge in real-world scenarios, and my mentor provided constructive feedback that helped me refine my skills.\n\nOne of my main achievements was leading a usability testing session, which resulted in actionable insights for the team. This experience greatly improved my proficiency in Figma and enhanced my communication and teamwork abilities. Overall, the internship deepened my understanding of user-centered design and the importance of iterative development.\n\nI worked on the redesign of an e-commerce application, focusing on improving the checkout process to reduce cart abandonment. Through user interviews and journey mapping, I identified key pain points and proposed design solutions that resulted in a 15% decrease in abandonment rate during A/B testing.\n\nThe technical skills I developed during this internship include:\n- Proficiency in design tools (Figma, Adobe XD)\n- User research methodologies and usability testing\n- Information architecture and interaction design\n- Design system creation and maintenance\n- Prototyping and design handoff to development teams\n\nI also gained valuable experience in collaborating with cross-functional teams, presenting design decisions to stakeholders, and balancing user needs with business requirements.\n\nMy User Experience Design and Human-Computer Interaction courses provided a strong foundation for this internship. The principles of cognitive psychology, usability heuristics, and design thinking methodologies were directly applicable to my daily work at Creative Solutions.',
